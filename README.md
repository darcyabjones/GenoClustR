# GenoClustR

GenoClustR is an R-package to detect co-located clusters of genomic features with common features.
For example, clusters of co-regulated genes or regions of functional enrichment.
Here we mean 'co-located' and 'spatial' in the sense of genomic position, not in 3D space.

> **NOTE** This is currently a very early draft and should not be considered as ready for use (yet).


## Installation

You can install the development version of GenoClustR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("darcyabjones/GenoClustR")
```

## Example

In the future we'll have some simple examples of things you can do here.
For now it's just boilerplate.

``` r
library(GenoClustR)
## basic example code
```
